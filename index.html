          <p class="--color">‚ÄúBefore joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learnprogramming step by step. I was encouragedto enroll by a former 
          student of theirs who can only saywonderful things about the program. Theentire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were veryhands-on and I never had to wait long forassistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding.It took my learning to the next level in away that no tutorial 
          could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve oftenreferred to it during interviews as anexample of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land ajob as a full-stack developer afterreceiving multiple offers. 
          100% recommend! ‚Äù</p>
